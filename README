  Measurement noise matrix (R):
    low values of noise ensures that our kalman filter's predicted mean will quickly match with the observed mean even with a poor initialization.
    with high values of noise, it takes more frames for the predicted position to match the observed ones.

  Of note, it takes at least 2 frames to have an acceptable match between predicted position and observed position as the first frame with correct the position, and the second one the speed for the next predictions.

  Covariance noise matrix (Q):
    low values of noise will accentuate the velocity in the state, and the predicted mean will likely diverge from the observed one.
    with high values, the velocity in the state decreases and will match the observed position.
